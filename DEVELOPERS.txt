  DEVELOPER INFO FOR ISTAT
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 1. Prerequisites
 
 You will need GNU autoconf installed. Most Linux distributions include
 this in a package named "autoconf" or "autoconf-26" or similar. You will
 need at least version 2.61 of autoconf.
 
 You will also need libxml2. If your operating system has separate 'user'
 and 'developer' packages, you will need to install the 'developer' package.
 For example, on Ubuntu, you need to install 'libxml2-dev'. This package
 contains the header files and libraries used at compile-time.
 
 At present, iStat Server only builds and runs on Linux. Ports to other
 operating systems are planned!
 
 2. Preparing the source tree (Subversion check-outs only)
 
 If you've checked out the sources from the Subversion repository or have
 downloaded a snapshot, your source directory won't contain a 'configure'
 script and you will need to run autoconf to generate one.
 
 You might find that even though you have autoconf installed, the actual
 autoconf program is installed as 'autoconf26' or 'autoconf-2.6' or similar.
 If so, the same will apply to 'autoheader', too. Substitute the appropriate
 names when running the below commands:
 
 Check out the source tree if you haven't already:
 
 $ svn co http://istat.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ istat
 
 Change to the source directory, if you're not in it already:
 
 $ cd istat
 
 Generate config.h.in and configure from the configure.in template:
 
 $ autoheader
 $ autoconf

 If you (or somebody else) makes changes to configure.in, you will need
 to re-run the above two commands.

 3. Run the configure script
 
 For a default configuration, simply run the configure script in the
 source directory. This will perform tests on your build environment and
 generate a Makefile:
 
 $ ./configure
 
 By default, the configure script will generate a Makefile which installs
 files to /usr/local. You can change this with the --prefix option:
 
 $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/istat
 
 If you wish to have the configuration file, istat.conf, stored in /etc,
 then you can specify this location in the configure command:
 
 $ ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc
 
 The defaults should be fine for most users, and shouldn't conflict with
 packages supplied by your operating system vendor.
 
 4. Build it!
 
 $ make

 If successful, you should be left with an 'istatd' binary.
 
 5. Install it
 
 Generally, you will need to be an administrator user in order to install it.
 This varies between distributions, but typically you can install with:
 
 $ sudo make install
 
 If you want to prefix installation paths in order to install a staging 
 directory (for example, for packaging), set the DESTDIR variable:
 
 $ sudo make install DESTDIR=/tmp/istat-packaging
