  TODO FOR ISTAT - Feel free to add more stuff here and submit patches :)
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Make it optional to display mount name instead of disk name.
  
  * Installation process, create rpm spec files and other packaging:

    useradd istat -d /var/run/istat
    groupadd istat
    mkdir -p /var/{cache,run}/istat
    chown istat.istat /var/{cache,run}/istat
 
  * /var/cache/istat/client.dat should have permissions 700.
  
  * Write config validation code in conf.cpp - validate()
  
  * Clean up stdout messages and create a logger in style of:
  
    log.info() << "Log this: " << var;
    log.warn() << "Ou panic!";

  * Support for fans and temperature messure (lm-sensor?)
  
  * Tests for which libraries networking stuff lives in (on Solaris, these live
    in -lsocket and -lnsl)
    
  * Tests for the specific introspection APIs (so that alternatives can be used
    on platforms other than Linux)
    
  * Properly determine and substitute the configuration file path into config.h
    so that the code can default properly
    
  * Remove the "if prefix is /usr, force sysconfdir to be /etc" kludge from the
    makefile (it'd need to be moved to configure for the above  change anyway,
    and it's really what --sysconfdir=/etc is for!)
    
  * Port it to other platforms :)
